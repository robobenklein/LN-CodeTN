Our CodeTN Competition code.

For our Javascript team, check out this site: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp
You'll be able to edit javascript in real time next to the visual result.

For our HTML team, watch this repository hourly so you can see the changes.  The code will be moving fast here.

For our documentation team, watch the code a lot on 11/9/2014, as the UI is being made and the code debugged.

Good luck team!

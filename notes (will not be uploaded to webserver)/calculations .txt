calculations:
====================

energy produced in watts over a year:
	panelpower * 4.64 (average sunlight hours per year) * 365 (days in a year) = panelpowerperyear
	panelpowerperyear * 0.001 (convert to kilowatts from watts) = panelkwhperyear
	panelkwhperyear * efficiency = paneloutputfinal
	
payoff time (payofftime)
	(budget + install) / (paneloutputfinal * kwh)
	
money saved in ten years:
	(paneloutputfinal * 10 * kwh) - budget - install

money spent:
	budget + install

Good investment if:
	if payofftime < payoff
		yes
	else
		nah

panels needed:
	area of the school * 85% (the rest is for like spare space and stuff)
	/ (length * height)
	output is number of panels that can be purchased
